THIS IS ANNA'S ART. IT IS THE PRODUCT OF OUR COLLABORATION. ANNA AS THE ARTIST WITH DEMENTIA AND ME (THE ARTIST WITH HER BIGGEST SMILE EVER) ANNA'S VOLUNTEER PARTNER POSITIVELY REELING FROM A MIND BLOWING GREAT EXPERIENCE.
![The certification course was completed in June 2016. The experience was in a word "trans-formative", it transformed my elder artist partner who made beautiful art (see the artwork image) Anna's Art.  I was completely blown away by the process, the outcome and the positive influence art making had on a wonderful woman initially sadly pleading, "I wanna go home", transforming her into an artist as evidenced by her own words, "Well, I'll be damned, I am an artist...watch out I'm good...you wanna pat me on the back?" Yes really.  If I had not witnessed this myself I would not really believe the trans-formative power of ART and ART MAKING.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7c3f15ba-913b-4b98-bb5e-0a431f98774a.jpg)
