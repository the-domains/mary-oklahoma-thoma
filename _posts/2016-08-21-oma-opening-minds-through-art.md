# OMA

# (Opening Minds through ART)
![The certification course was completed in June 2016. The experience was in a word "trans-formative", it transformed my elder artist partner who made beautiful art (see the artwork image) Anna's Art.  I was completely blown away by the process, the outcome and the positive influence art making had on a wonderful woman initially sadly pleading, "I wanna go home", transforming her into an artist as evidenced by her own words, "Well, I'll be damned, I am an artist...watch out I'm good...you wanna pat me on the back?" Yes really.  If I had not witnessed this myself I would not really believe the trans-formative power of ART and ART MAKING.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7c3f15ba-913b-4b98-bb5e-0a431f98774a.jpg)
