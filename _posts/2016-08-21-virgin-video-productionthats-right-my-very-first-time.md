title: VIRGIN VIDEO PRODUCTION…THAT’S RIGHT MY VERY FIRST TIME.
publisher: {}
description: >-
  Below the Surface: My very first video ever, recorded, edited and staring
  your’s truly, MaryOklahomaThoma. I am not crazy about how the artwork turned
  out but I really like the video final outcome. I felt good about it for my
  VIRGIN VIDEO run. It certainly made me aware of what I like and don’t like
  about the process I used. Just like all fledgling film makers, the learning
  curve is under negotiation. Feedback is always helpful, plus you could like,
  subscribe and share. I am developing a “video studio” and my video creations
  will start airing on a regular basis this fall.

# VIRGIN VIDEO PRODUCTION...THAT'S RIGHT MY VERY FIRST TIME.

Below the Surface: My very first video ever, recorded, edited and staring your's truly, MaryOklahomaThoma. I am not crazy about how the artwork turned out but I really like the video final outcome. I felt good about it for my VIRGIN VIDEO run. It certainly made me aware of what I like and don't like about the process I used. Just like all fledgling film makers, the learning curve is under negotiation. Feedback is always helpful, plus you could like, subscribe and share. I am developing a "video studio" and my video creations will start airing on a regular basis this fall.
